Hi, I'm Thomas and Deep Weird is where I talk about playing and designing games. If you want to reach me, message me on twitter [@chaibypost](www.twitter.com/chaibypost) or drop me an email notrueindian at outlook.com

I came to games in a weird way - through the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson which began as a 8 year long AD&D/GURPS campaign. People talk about the different kinds of RPG designers and yes, I'm the failed novelist. I mostly play games over text - because roleplaying through writing allows me to indulge both my primary interests. I currently moderate the [r/pbp](https://www.reddit.com/r/pbp/) (pbp = play-by-post) subreddit which has around 4000 members as of July 2020, all of them playing games over text for various reasons. 

My only professional credit right now is as a writer for New Agenda Publishing on Orun: Post Apotheosis, Afro-Inspired, Space Opera RPG, which was [kickstarted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/newagendapubs/orun) in 2018. I've also been a sensitivity reader and done some minor layout work.

But I'm always tinkering away at my own games. Check out [my Itch store](https://notrueindian.itch.io/). My current work-in-progress is [Parliament of Knives](/parliament-of-knives/), my political intrigue RPG written to be played over Discord or a similar app. The entire game is available for free as markdown/HTML because this isn't a game meant to be played at a table so a PDF or print would be kind of ridiculous. Check it out! And if you like it, let me know!

This blog also contains my posts for Deepfolk, which is my leftist New Weird under-the-ocean setting for RPGs. It's in very early stages.
