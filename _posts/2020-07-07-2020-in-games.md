So far, my year in games has been:

* I completed my sandbox / West Marches-turned-traditional Descent into Avernus game over discord. I even [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/g9rw1p/i_finished_running_a_full_campaign_of_baldurs/) about in on reddit.
* The same group sort of continued into my gold-for-xp "low lives in a big city" take on Waterdeep: Dragon Heist. This will definitely be the last time I run a D&D 5e campaign. I don't want to patronize Wizards of the Coast any more. 
* A game of Kingdom ended prematurely as we couldn't really find a way to make it work. I don't think the game really clicked for me, not sure where we went wrong. I probably won't try it again. 
* I started playing in the Great Pendragon Campaign as a player. I have no idea how far we'll get but it feels pretty cool to be playing this little piece of RPG history. I'm playing a biracial knight - it's one of those things you do to test if you should join a game, you know? Ask the GM if you can play a non-white or a non-cis het man in a historical setting (a *seemingly* White historical setting like Arthurian legend) and see what they say. But my GM responded so wonderfully that I was overjoyed.
* I'm also running the first [Parliament of Knives](https://deepweird.com/parliament-of-knives) playtest server and it's going very well.
