 - [ ] Adding a soft murderizing option in the form of Blackmail

This currently version 0.6 and is the most updated version available on the internet.)

## Introduction

Parliament of Knives is a text-based roleplaying game of political intrigue that pits players against each other to see who can exert the most influence on the fate of a nation. The characters are all politicians in a Grand Parliament in one nation of a fantastical world making and voting on proposals in a bid to further their secret objectives. They form factions, leave factions, make deals, break deals, and even kill or be killed in their pursuit of getting the necessary votes they need to further their plans.

The players portray their characters and enact surprising plans and schemes while being careful to foster a welcoming, fun and safe atmosphere. The game facilitators adjudicate the rules, portray the external world and NPCs, ameliorate player conflict, and ensure a safe play space. The game should work best with between 15-30 players.

**How do we play?**

There are several parts to this game:

* The [forum](#forum) where the game is played
* The [fictional world](#fictional-world) where the game is set
* The players and their [characters](#characters)
* The [parties](#parties) that players form
* The [mechanics](#mechanics) that govern the game
* The game [facilitators](#facilitators) and their responsibilities
    
Each of these is discussed below in this document.

## Forum

The forum is a digital space where the game is played. It could be Discord server, a Slack room or a Discourse forum. It is set up to resemble the physical and social layout of a parliament building as well as the personal offices of the various political parties that make up the parliament. There are two kinds of spaces or channels: public and private. Public channels are visible and accessible to all members. Private channels are only visible and accessible to members who have explicit permissions.

Public channels are spaces like the central chamber of the parliament, the corridors of the parliament building, and so on. Private channels are spaces like party offices or other self-defined private spaces invented by the characters.

Note: Group messaging outside of the forum for out of character planning is a practice that is contra to the spirit of the game. If any player needs a channel accessible to only a specific group of players, the facilitators should create the channel for them as soon as they can.

(For a full template for the forum, see Appendix 1.)

## Fictional World

The fictional nation represented by the Grand Parliament can be the one outlined in these rules or one that is invented by the game facilitators. It can be a part of a world that is as fantastical or mundane as desired but these rules assume that the characters have access to no magic or similar powers. They have to rely on their wits, words and, occasionally, rusty knives. It is the role of the facilitators to portray a believable world that is responsive to the actions of the Grand Parliament. It is suggested that the world contains a map that can be edited easily to show geopolitical changes.

The nation has six stats: Military, Art, Industry, Faith, Diplomacy, Commerce. 

The stats range from 1-8 and start at 3. Every successful proposal passed by the parliament influences these stats - by increasing or lowering one or both. If any stat falls to 1, it triggers a Major Event which if not handled appropriately through roleplay and proposals, the game ends.

(For a template for designing your world and nation, see Appendix 2.)

## Characters

The characters in this game are all politicians in a Grand Parliament.

Character creation isn’t elaborate. It is as simple as choosing an archetype and answering a series of questions. The currently available playsets are:

| The Noble                                                    |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Noble is a member of a powerful and aristocratic house. They start with 3 Prestige.<br /><br />Questions: <br />What is your noble house most famous for? <br />What is your position within the noble house? <br />Are you the head of the house or a young scion? Are you well-liked? What is your house’s best kept secret? | <img src="/assets/img/noble.png" style="width:215px; height:auto;">   |

| The Rascal                                                   |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Rascal has reached their current position through wheeling and dealing. They start with 2 Prestige. Once a week, they can ask to know how one character voted in the previous week.<br /><br />Questions:<br />What were the origins of your birth? <br />What is the most outrageous trick you pulled off to achieve power? <br />What mistake do you regret the most? | <img src="/assets/img/rascal.png" style="width:215px; height:auto;">|

| The Soldier                                                   |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Soldier is a former leader of the armed forces of the nation. They start with 2 Prestige. The cost to murderize them is higher by 2.<br /><br />Questions:<br />What code of honour do you follow?<br />What was your noblest deed in battle?<br />What circumstances turned you into a political leader? | <img src="/assets/img/soldier.png" style="width:215px; height:auto;">  |

| The Dreamer                                                   |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The Dreamer is an artist, poet or philosopher. They start with 2 Prestige. They get half-Prestige from voting but cannot be murderized or challenged to duels unless they choose. For voting, their prestige is rounded down.<br /><br />(Note: If a player might not be comfortable with their character dying, this is the archetype they should choose.)<br /><br />Questions:<br />What are you famous for? <br />What has gotten you into the most trouble with the government or the people?<br />What is your favourite topic of conversation? | <img src="/assets/img/dreamer.png" style="width:215px; height:auto;">|

   
## Parties

This game cannot be won alone. Characters will need to form parties. Parties are volatile alliances for a common cause. Within parties, players can figure out proposals and strategies. The Party creation process is simple. Parties need a logo, a manifesto and objective. A manifesto can take any form but should contain a number of lies and truths about the party’s objective.

A party’s objective is usually one of the following and they map onto the nation’s stats:

1.  Conquer the World (Military)
2.  Usher in a Golden Age of Art and Culture (Art)
3.  Achieve an Industrial Revolution (Industry)
4.  Institute a New State Religion (Religion)
5.  Become a World Leader through Peace and Goodwill (Diplomacy)
6.  Become the Economic Superpower (Commerce)
    
When a party passes a proposal pertaining to their objective, all of their members earn Prestige. When a party raises the stat that matches their objective to their maximum value, they win the game. Multiple parties can share the same objective.

When characters leave a party, they lose Prestige, unless it’s a Schism. A Schism is when more than 25% of the party splits and forms a new party in which case no Prestige is lost (minimum 2 people).

## Mechanics

So how does the game work?

The core of the game is very simple: Characters make proposals, which are potential laws or actions that the nation should take. The members of the Grand Parliament then vote on these proposals, passing some of them and rejecting the others. But the gap between proposing something and getting it passed is where most of the game will happen. Being successful in making and passing proposals earns characters Prestige.

The game is played more or less in real time. Every round of the game takes place over one week. A week / round should look like this:

Day 1: Members declare Proposals.
Day 2-5: Voting opens. Members speechify, scheme, ally, lie to get other Members to vote on what they want.
Day 6: Voting closes. Successful proposals are declared. Prestige is announced, if applicable.
Day 7: News, Rumours and Events, if any, are announced.

**Proposals**: Any member can make a Proposal. The aim of Proposals is to earn Prestige for the player and to help the Party get closer to winning. Every proposal has consequences - both in terms of moving the fiction of the world forward and affecting the stats.

How do proposals affect the nation’s stats? Every proposal declares which stat the character intends to raise and which it intends to lower. For every successful proposal, the facilitators roll a d8 and compare it to the two stats mentioned in the proposal. If the number on the dice is greater than the stat to be raised, then the intended stat increases by 1. If the number on the dice is less than or equal to the stat to be lowered, then that stat is reduced by 1.

 When making a proposal, a character declares the title of the proposal and explains their reasons behind proposing it. They also declare which stat they want the proposal to raise and which stat they want to lower.

Example: “Proposal: Make Necromancy Legal [Aim: Increase Industry, Decrease Religion]”

Note: It is up to the player to have their character justify the out of character choice of stats through roleplay in-character. In this example, they might do so by declaring that the interdiction against necromancy is religious but if we legalize the act, the undead can be made to work in factories.

(For a list of sample proposals, see Appendix 3.)

**Prestige**: Prestige is a double-edged sword. In many ways, it is the measure of your success and power. The higher your prestige, the more your vote matters. But becoming too successful or powerful has a downside. You open yourself to jealous conspiracies. Once a character has reached Prestige 6, they become potential targets for MurderizingTM and Duels of Honour, which are ways of losing prestige and potentially your character.
 
Characters earn Prestige when:
-   They make a successful proposal (+2)
-   They vote on a successful proposal (+1)

Characters lose Prestige when:
-   They quit their party (unless it’s a Schism) (-1)
-   They murderize somebody (-1)
-   They lose a Duel of Honour (see Duel rules)
    
**Voting**: Votes are private and cast via an external form where only the facilitators can see the result. Once cast, they cannot be taken back. 

Every character only gets one vote. But their vote increases in value with their Prestige. A person with Prestige 10 is worth the same as 10 people with Prestige 1.

Example, someone proposes that “All healthcare should be free”. After voting, the votes for the proposals are 25 people of Prestige 1, 3 people of Prestige 2, 1 person of Prestige 3, and 1 person of Prestige 4. Therefore, the “total vote” on this proposal is: 25x1+3x2+1x3+1x4 = 25+6+3+4 = 38.  
  
The proposals with the two highest total votes at the end of the week are accepted. 

**Murderizing**: This is the Julius Caesar rule. High-prestige players are ripe targets for murderizing. To murderize a player, a character must gather a conspiracy of other characters (from any party) equal to the target’s Prestige (8 Prestige means 8 Players). Then, they must lure the target to a place where they are “alone” i.e. any channel where only conspirators and the target are actively present in the scene. Then, everyone involved in the murder has to post the :knife: emoji. (Once the first :knife: emoji has been posted, the target cannot leave the channel till it is clear if the murderizing failed or succeeded.)

 If enough people post the emoji, the target has a choice: they either die or retire into the woods. The player can make an entirely new character, including the child of their old character hankering for revenge. Every player involved in the murder loses 1 Prestige.

Note: Being "alone" might be a strange idea in a digital space but it can be implemented in a straightforward manner by making it explicit to the players that their character can only be active in one public channel and one private channel at a time. This gives them a certain physicality or spatial anchoring. They "leave" channels or spaces and "enter" others.

**Duels of Honour**: Duels of Honour are the more noble way of getting rid of opposing characters. If a character feels insulted or betrayed by another character, they can give them a glove. This is a warning. If the character feels insulted or betrayed for a second time, they throw their second glove at them. This means a Duel of Honour has been called. You can only challenge characters of higher Prestige than you. When a Duel is called, both parties must name a “second”. If either lose, their second can issue a follow-up Duel challenge to the winner. Nobody else can challenge the original winner or loser for the next 7 days.

 The two characters go to the Duelling Court and draw their weapons. The duel is resolved through dice. Each player rolls 4d6. After they roll, they count how many dice are either 4,5 or 6. Each such die counts as a Hit. The player with the lower number of Hits is considered to be losing. Ties are rerolled.

The losing player has a choice: lose gracefully or escalate. If they lose gracefully, they lose Prestige equal to the number of Hits scored by their opponent (but you cannot go below your starting Prestige). If they escalate, they get to choose to reroll any of their 4 dice, keeping the rest. After rerolling, they might still be losing or be winning. If they are still losing, they can again either lose gracefully or escalate again. If they are still losing after this, they have lost the fight. They must now decide if they die or fall back to their starting Prestige (based on their playset).

If they were at any point winning, the other player must choose whether to lose gracefully or escalate. They too cannot escalate more than twice. When escalating, if there is a tie, the type of tie matters. If you are advancing to a tie, that’s a win. If you are remaining at a tie, that’s a loss.

Here’s an example duel:

> Rattle (Prestige 5) challenges Bones (Prestige 10) to a duel. Rattle
> nominates Kell as their second, Bones nominates Zin.
> 
> In the first round, Rattle rolls 4d6 getting 5,4,3,1 which is 2 Hits.  Bones rolls 4d6 getting 1,1,1,6 which is 1 Hit. Bones could choose to lose gracefully and take -2 to Prestige putting them at 8. Or they can escalate. Bones decides that they aren’t going to lose and escalates!
> 
> Bones has 1 Hit (a 6) so they set that dice aside and reroll 3d6
> getting 2,2,4 which is 1 Hit, taking their total to 2 Hits. This is
> now a tie. But if you advance to a tie from losing, you are considered to be winning. So now Rattle has a choice: lose gracefully (-2 Prestige) or escalate! They choose to escalate!
> 
> Rattle keeps the 2 Hits (5,4) and rerolls 2d6 getting 3,3 which 0 new Hits. So it is still a tie but if you remain at a tie, you are still losing. Rattle is desperate and chooses to escalate again! They reroll d6 and get 4,6 which is 2 Hits. They now have 4 Hits. Now, Bones can lose gracefully and take -4 to Prestige, dropping them to 6 Prestige. Or they can escalate but if they are still losing after escalating, they will either die or go back down to starting Prestige which for them was 2. Ouch. Bones, filled with regret, chooses to lose gracefully. Rattle wins!
> 
> Now Zin, Bones’ second, can challenge. Rattle to follow-up duel but they decide against it. The duel ends here.

Note: If using the Sidekick bot on Discord, you can use a command like “/r xd6>3” to roll and count Hits at once, where 'x' is the number of dice/

**News**: Every week, after the results of the vote are announced. Game facilitators will post a series of updates in the “News” channel.

Eg: "The Rolan Empire has amassed soldiers on our southern border." or “A cult of devil worshippers has taken root in our Capitol.”

**Rumours**: Game facilitators will post potentially true or false rumours to a Rumours channel, which will mostly be gossip about what happened in the private channels of various parties.

**Events**: Game facilitations will also organize Events that take place in response to the actions of the Parliament. These could be meetings with Generals who would lead wars, Foreign Diplomats from other nations, Reporters investigating malfeasance, etc. These NPCs would be played by the facilitators. If this event is in response to a stat reaching 1, then the facilitators should ensure that the event communicates its high stakes nature and a sense of urgency.

**Ending the Game**: The game ends when a party maximizes the stat related to their objective or when a stat is lowered to one and the players are not able to turn it around in the next week. Either way, if the players wish to start a new game, build a new nation extrapolating from the consequences of this recently-ended game and start again.

## Facilitators

Last but not the least, the game also requires facilitators to perform a number of functions including:

**Moderate the community**: The Discord server like any server or offline community space needs to be maintained. This involves both technical tasks like the creation or deletion of channels and social tasks like handling complaints from members. A fun and safe playing environment involves a lot of different factors that probably go beyond this ruleset.

**Track Votes and Prestige**: Facilitators need to handle the backend of votes, proposals and prestige. They need to calculate which proposals have been passed and make sure an accurate tally of prestige is maintained.

**Bring the world to life**: The world responds to the actions of the council in two forms: News, which are brief text updates, and Events, which involve NPCs with agendas and demands. The game facilitators decide how the world will respond to the events of the Parliament and how that response should manifest. Facilitators also post Rumours, which are true or false gossip about the characters in Parliament.

 (This probably needs to be fleshed out more.)
